# Old Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of old code snippets and projects, showcasing programming knowledge and skills in various languages, including C++, Java, Python, Shell scripting, SQL, and HTML. The projects are organized by language and academic context, with many originating from coursework at Ontario Tech University.

## Repository Structure

### C++
The `c++` folder contains projects demonstrating concepts such as algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, dynamic memory management, and more. Key subfolders include:
- **academia/postsecondary/programmingworkshop**: Coursework for CSCI1010U and CSCI1020U (Programming Workshop I & II). Examples:
  - `Algorithms.cpp`: Implements linear search, binary search, and bubble sort algorithms.
  - `Stack.cpp`: Demonstrates stack implementation using arrays.
  - `VehicleOpOverloading.cpp`: Demonstrates operator overloading.
  - `DynamicMem.cpp`: Explores dynamic memory allocation.
  - `bitstuffing.cpp`: Reads and processes bit sequences from a file.
- **academia/postsecondary/softwaredesign**: Coursework for CSCI2040U (Software Design and Analysis). Contains projects related to software design principles.

### Java
The `java` folder includes projects focused on object-oriented programming, data structures, and software systems development. Key subfolders include:
- **academia/uni-postsecondary/datastructures**: Coursework for CSCI2010U (Data Structures). Examples:
  - `TreeLab`: Implements tree-based structures and operations.
  - `Stacks and Queues Lab`: Simulates a burrito shop using stacks and queues.
- **academia/uni-postsecondary/softwaresystems**: Coursework for CSCI2020U (Software Systems Development & Integration). Examples:
  - `FileSharingSystem`: A GUI-based file-sharing application.
  - `SpaceExploration`: Simulates space mission management using a facade pattern.

### Python
The `python` folder contains projects from various academic years and courses. Examples include:
- `Fibonacci.py`: Calculates Fibonacci sequences.
- `historic-autoscrob.py`: Project for music data processing.
- `pytorch_essentials.py`: Introduces PyTorch for machine learning.

### Shell
The `shell` folder contains scripts for system automation. Example:
- `backup.sh`: Automates file backups.

### SQL
The `sql` folder includes database-related projects. Example:
- `chicago_datasets.ipynb`: Analyzes datasets using SQL queries.

### HTML
The `html` folder contains web development projects. Examples include:
- `build-a-travel-agency-page.html`: A travel agency webpage.
- `build-a-video-compilation-page.html`: A video compilation webpage.
